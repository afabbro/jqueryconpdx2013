intro

working memory
- durr

attention
- you suck at it

(working memory and attention are related)

shadow DOM/encapsulation (as an ideal)
- encapsulation - power rangers metaphor again
- explain shadow dom
- explain webcomponents (hat term)

writing small programs
- ggood for modularity
- good for maintainability
- good for reducing cognitive load at a given point in development

components
- use drupal as an example
- use x-tags repo and components as examples

how should we write programs that are modular
- if a component is very specific (small feature), then a function must also be specific 
- no fucking huge functions
- if you write a lib or a plugin let developers have it a-la-carte

picni.cc
- introduce picni.cc
- show an example of how to use it so devs can make their library a-la-lcarte

outro aw yeah
